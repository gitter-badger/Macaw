For that we must work around the limitationsâ€¦ it's a bit outside the box and Macaw loses some values but can be useful to export a good looking CSS file.\r\nI also noticed that Macaw helped a lots of users to understand HTML and CSS thanks to its awesome UI.\r\n\r\nHere, you'll find some ready to use components, example files or even full templates.\r\n\r\nIf you have a specific problem, ask me directly in the forum.\r\n\r\nThanks!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
