#Hi

Since I'm one of the moderator of the official (forum of Macaw)[forum.macaw.co] I tried to help some users of Macaw who can sometimes stuck on simple things. Macaw is best used to quick wireframes but you can use it for other things, like some prototype, even complicated ones. For that we must work around the limitationsâ€¦ it's a bit outside the box, Macaw loses some values but can be useuful to export a not so bad CSS.
I noticed that lots of users found some help to understand HTML and CSS with the help of the UI of Macaw.

Here, you'll find some ready to use components, example files or even templates.

And if you have a specific problem, ask me directly in the forum.
Thanks!
