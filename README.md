#Hi

Since I'm one of the moderator of the official [forum of Macaw](http://forum.macaw.co) I oftenly tried to help some users of Macaw who can sometimes stuck on simple things by giving them some example files.
Macaw is best used to quick wireframes but you can use it for other things, like some prototype, even complicated ones. For that we must work around the limitationsâ€¦ it's a bit outside the box and Macaw loses some values but can be useful to export a good looking CSS file.
I also noticed that Macaw helped a lots of users to understand HTML and CSS thanks to its awesome UI.

Here, you'll find some ready to use components, example files or even full templates.

If you have a specific problem, ask me directly in the forum.

Thanks!
